Script for Rainforest Automation Eagle-200

Use the shell script "racmd" to send XML commands to the unit - usage:

./racmd <xml file>

racmd has three variables - RAHOST for the device, RAUSER and RAPASS for
credentials for access control.

The following XML commands are in files:

devlst.xml	Use this to get the hardware address of the meter which
                is needed in the other scripts.

You need to edit the following files to use the Hardware address of your
meter from the script above.

getdetails.xml	Use this to get all the information extracted from the 
                meter.  This includes mutliplier/divisor information for
                your meter as well as the information it maintains and you
                can query.  Some of the fields return either null or zero as
                PG&E doesn't seem to use them.

getsum.xml	Gets the current demand and summation delivered from  the 
                meter.


rfepoch.php is old and I don't think required.  It converted UNIX time into
the Epoch used by Rainforest - this was used for the old RainForest cloud
queries via XML which as no longer required as you get the information
directly from the Eagle-200 on the local network.
